# 🏠 Homelab Documentation

Welcome to my Homelab Documentation repository — a collection of structured notes, lab configurations, networking guides, and IT practice materials used to build real-world skills in system administration, networking, virtualization, and ServiceNow development.

This repo showcases my hands-on learning in:
- Windows Server & Active Directory
- Networking (DNS, DHCP, VLANs)
- VirtualBox & VM management
- Linux systems
- PowerShell scripting
- ServiceNow development & workflows

## 📌 Notes

This repository is part of my continuous learning journey from help desk → system administration → ServiceNow development.  
It shows real practice, real notes, real troubleshooting — not copy/paste textbook content.

Always improving. Always learning.
